# ECLectic: Open Tools for Electrochemiluminescence Measurements and Analysis Platforms

## Overview

**ECLectic** is an open, collaborative repository hosting scripts, datasets, and analysis workflows developed within the [**ECLectic Doctoral Network**](https://eclectic-dn.eu/), funded by the European Union’s Horizon Europe programme (MSCA Grant Agreement 101119951).
This resource supports multiple peer-reviewed publications advancing electrochemiluminescence (ECL), chemiluminescence, and chemical/biological imaging.
Each publication or major project module is maintained in its own branch, providing self-contained code, data, and documentation for reproducible research and open science.

The ECLectic project addresses urgent global health challenges—such as rapid detection of sepsis and bacterial infections—by developing next-generation ECL-based biosensors. These tools combine nanomaterials and microfluidics to enable fast, reliable, point-of-care diagnostics, supporting timely treatment decisions and reducing antibiotic misuse.

Beyond research, ECLectic is establishing a European Center of Excellence to train the next generation of scientists in biosensing, materials chemistry, microfluidics, and electrochemistry—preparing them to drive future innovations in both academia and industry.

## Repository Structure
